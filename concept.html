							  Hear Here 2.0 is a reimagining of the original Hear Here targeted speaker concept developed by Rafi, Sam,
							  and Misha in 2019. It uses a parametric speaker to deliver directed audio, guided by computer vision to
							  ensure continuous audio delivery to a particular target. Our device is designed to deliver personalized
							  audio to a single person within the scope of a room.
							</p>
							<h4> What is a parametric speaker?</h4>
							<p>
							  A parametric speaker is a special kind of audio device designed to deliver an audio beam much narrower
							  than a conventional loudspeaker. Such a beam can be narrow enough to affect only a single person in a
							  crowded room, which makes this technology perfect for targeted advertisement or content delivery. You 
							  can learn more about this technology by referencing the "Transducer" and "Physics" sections of our page.
							</p>
							<h4> How can we track a person? </h4>
							<p>
							  Our tracking mechanism relies on software running on a Raspberry Pi controlling a mechanized turret assembly 
							  to steer and aim our transducer. By mounting it in a central location on the ceiling of a room, we are able 
							  to direct the beam at our desired target without interference from objects or other people. You can find out 
							  more about out tracking assembly and software in the "Base Assembly" section.
