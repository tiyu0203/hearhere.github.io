								Parametric speakers function due to the non-linear interactions between high amplitude acoustic waves and fluids, such as air. Originally developed by sonar researchers during the Cold War, a parametric speaker can generate much narrower audio waves than similarly sized conventional speaker diaphragm. They operate due to pockets of high and low pressure that occur whenever a pressure wave passes through a fluid. The resulting compression and rarification results in formation of predictable low frequency waves that can be controlled using a specialized modulation scheme. The resulting effect is a virtual speaker diaphragm made up of air that can greatly exceed the size of the transucer. This allows for compact speakers to deliver narrow beams of audio.

								Conventional loudspeakers are fundamentally limited in their directivity due the nature of their construction. To better understand this property, we can approximate the sound intensity from a loudpeaker by computing the far-field pressure radiating from a circular piston. As we can see from the figure, the directivity of the sound field is determined by the product of the wavenumber k and the piston radius a. This means that for a given frequency, directivity is directly proportional to the size of the transducer.
							</p>
							<p>
								Because parametric arrays generate a virtual diaphragm of up to several meters in length and due to the complex interactions between ultrasonic waves and air, the resulting pressure field is much narrower and has supressed sidelobes. The result is that a relatively small parametric array can generate a narrow audio beam at audible frequencies.
